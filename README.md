# GPA1
```GPA1.R``` : This script processes genetic data by performing counting codons from fasta files, and merging results with clade information. It also generates summary tables for combinations of codons and their frequencies across different strains.

```1011-clades```: strain names and clades 1011 collection.

```pub-clades```: RUN code public strains and clade name according to their respective publications.

```GPA1.codonAA469.revcompl.vcf.gz```: reversed and complemented VCF file coordinates for aa 469.

```GPA1.codonAA82.revcompl.vcf.gz```: reversed and complemented VCF file coordinates for aa 82.

```GPA1.codonAA469.revcompl.min0.fasta```: FASTA file converted from VCF file for aa 469.

```GPA1.codonAA82.revcompl.min0.fasta```: FASTA file converted from VCF file for aa 82.

```summary_table_perclade_GPA1_aa82aa469.txt```: per clade summary table for aa82-aa469.

```summary_table_perstrain_GPA1_aa82aa469.txt```: per strain summary table for aa82-aa469.
